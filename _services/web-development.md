## Thanks for checking out my new blog!

I never really haven't had a portfolio that I've been proud of, As a developer a great portfolio is crucial to representing yourself to recruiters and potential employers. I built my last blog roughly a year ago using Gatsby.js. I love the framework, however I do feel it provides too much magic out of the box, so I opted to use Next.js instead.

This blog takes markdown and coverts them into individual blog posts. You can practically code the page to look anyway you like in these markdown files. Furthermore I optimized the SEO to have customizable OG-image cards so if a post of mine is shared, an image will populate in the link.

Be sure to check back often as I have several posts ready to be published, just need to convert them from notion first :).

### Where to go from here

1. I want to pull data in from my github and display it on the portfolio page. I'm holding off as I have several new projects I'm working on and these take precedence.
2. Share post button on each blog page.
3. update design on the landing page.
4. Printable resume
